Setup:
1. Place the StreamingAssets folder from the .zip into your DaggerfallUnity_Data\ directory and overwrite if applicable.
2. Ensure that no key binds are set to the number row.

How To Use:
1. In either your inventory or spellbook menu, hold down a key on your number row. A numbered grid should now be visible on the top-right.
2. Left-click an item or spell to bind it to a numerical key.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for the same item/spell to toggle the hotkey back to clear.
4. If an equippable item has an on-use enchantment, you will be prompted to either key the item as a Useable or Equippable. Select "Yes" to key it as a useable magic item. Select "No" to key it for equipping/unequipping.
